Repository for NTU Course - CE/CZ 4042 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
### To-do:
> - Decide on the model architecture - try different types of LSTM layers, where we put dropouts
> - Introduction - what is the problem statement - why we use LSTM solely for this project, and how we tried different types of LSTM techniques, different model architectures, best accuracy chosen, challenges, optimization of the parameters, summarize the results + observations - document all the experiments, data cleaning as well
> - Hyperparameter Opt - on different parameters
> - Train the model
> - Start writing the report 
> - Video :')
